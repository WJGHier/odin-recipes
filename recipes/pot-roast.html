        <li>3-4 lb. Chuck Roast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons corn starch</li>
        <li>3 table spoons cold water</li>
    <h3>Meat Seasonings:</h3>
        <li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
     <h3>Gravy:</h3>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cube beef bullion</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
     <h3>Sides:</h3>
        <li>2 1/4 lbs. baby potatoes</li>
        <li>2 lbs. whole carrots</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat roast completely dry. Combine the seasoning ingredients and massage
            it onto all the sides of the roast, followed by the flour.
        </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil ina large pan over medium heat. Once the oil is shiny and
            heated, add the roast and sear on each side for 2-3 minutes; until a brown
            crust has developed. Decrease heat slightly if needed during cooking. Remove
            from heat and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk together the gravy ingredients and add some of it to the skillet that
            you used to sear the roast. Use a silicon spatula to 'clean' the bottom and
            sides of the skillet, this will give more flavor to the gravy. Transfer it to
            the slow cooker along with the remaining gravy mix, followed by the pot roast
            and juices from the plate.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the potatoes into halves or thirds.</li>
        <li>Peel the carrots and slice them into halves or thirds.</li>
        <li>Arrange the carrots and potatoes around the roast and place the lid
            securely on top of the crock pot.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook on high for 5-6 hours</strong>or on<strong>for 8-10 hours</strong>
